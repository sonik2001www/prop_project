   - Download the official PostgreSQL installer for MacOS from [the official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/).
   - Follow the instructions to install PostgreSQL on your machine.

- **Create a Database:**
   - After installing PostgreSQL, open the Terminal.
   - Start the PostgreSQL command line by typing:
     ```
     psql -U postgres
     ```
   - Enter the password you set during the PostgreSQL installation (default password is usually blank).
   - To create a new database, type:
     ```
     CREATE DATABASE ytcom;
     ```

- **Create a User:**
   - To create a new user (e.g., root) with a password, type:
     ```
     CREATE USER root WITH PASSWORD '1234';
     ```
   - Grant all privileges to the user on the database:
     ```
     GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE ytcom TO root;

     ```

After this, you can proceed with setting up your virtual environment, activating it, and performing migrations for your Django project.


### 5. Configuration Setup

To configure the project settings, create a file named `Config.py` at the project's root level. In this file, define the following variables:

```python
SECRET_KEY = 'YOUR_SECRET_KEY'
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HOST_USER'
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'YOUR_EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD'
API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Explanation of each variable:

- `SECRET_KEY`: This variable represents a secret key used for cryptographic signing in Django. It is crucial for the security of your application as it is used to generate hashes for various security elements like cookies and CSRF tokens. It should be kept confidential and never shared publicly.
- `EMAIL_HOST_USER`: This variable represents the email address used for sending emails from your Django application. It typically corresponds to the email account associated with your email service provider, such as Gmail, Outlook, or your custom SMTP server.
- `EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`: This variable represents the password associated with the email address specified in `EMAIL_HOST_USER`. It is used for authentication when sending emails from your Django application.
- `API_KEY`: This variable represents the API key required for accessing the YouTube Data API. You can get the key here: [get YouTube API Key](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)

### 6. Migrations

- After activating the virtual environment, you can run Django migrations:

~~~
python manage.py migrate
~~~


### 7. Running the Server

To run the development server for your Django application, navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal or command prompt and execute the following command:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
